# Write a method combine_anagrams(words) that, given an array of strings words,
# groups the input words into anagram groups. Case doesn't matter in
# classifying strings as anagrams (but case should be preserved in the output),
# and the order of the anagrams in the groups doesn't matter. The output should
# be an array of anagram groups (i.e. an array of arrays).
